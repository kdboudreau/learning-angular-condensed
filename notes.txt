export: (like before the word class) means it can be used in another file.
import: used in the other file to make it accessable within that file
class: how an instance (or object) should look. a class is a blueprint of an object
property: classes contain properties, like variables
methods: classes have methods; these have parenthesis and a funtion body with code to execute
types: indicates what the variable is, like string. format is "aNumber: number". typescript can still infer types
