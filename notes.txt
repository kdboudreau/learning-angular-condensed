-- typescript features:
export: (like before the word class) means it can be used in another file.
import: used in the other file to make it accessable within that file
class: how an instance (or object) should look. a class is a blueprint of an object
property: classes contain properties, like variables
methods: classes have methods; these have parenthesis and a funtion body with code to execute
types: indicates what the variable is, like string. format is "aNumber: number". typescript can still infer types
@: decorator. this is a function which can attach to other constructs (like a class). it will always refer to what comes right
    after it. it can also be added to properties

-- components
angular adjusts the dom after the page is loaded. the html files get parsed and created as js, then adjust the dom based on
    template when the time comes
string interpolation
selector: this defines a css selector by which angular will identify this element (can also use a class, thoguh not common)
templateUrl: defines what to render. this is what to render when the selector is found
styleUrls: defines all the styles that should be applied to the template using the selector
only the AppComponent will be searched for by the index.html because it was added to the bootstrap array in app.module.ts
